# Peace of Mind â€“ Three.js + Typography Parallax Landing Page

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/miroleon/pen/MWzxdqr](https://codepen.io/miroleon/pen/MWzxdqr).

In this Codepen, you can see one way of approaching a parallax effect with some interactive typography and three.js. While I added a lot of documentation for you to follow along, you can also find a video tutorial on YouTube for the code!

Also, thanks to the Minneapolis Institute of Art for making the 3D model available in the public domain!
